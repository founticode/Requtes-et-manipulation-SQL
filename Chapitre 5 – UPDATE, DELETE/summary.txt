SQL UPDATE & DELETE – SUMMARY
=============================

1) Purpose
----------

The UPDATE and DELETE commands are used to modify
or remove existing records (rows) in a SQL table.
They must be used carefully to avoid data loss.


2) UPDATE Command
-----------------

Purpose:
UPDATE is used to change one or more values
in existing rows of a table.

Syntax:
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;


Example:
UPDATE Utilisateur
SET email = 'new@email.com'
WHERE id_utilisateur = 1;


Explanation:
- SET defines the new values
- WHERE selects which rows will be updated
- Only the matching rows are modified


3) Updating Multiple Fields
---------------------------

Example:
UPDATE Article
SET titre = 'New Title',
    date_publication = '2025-01-20'
WHERE id_article = 2;


4) Importance of WHERE (UPDATE)
--------------------------------

Without WHERE:
UPDATE Article
SET titre = 'Test';

Result:
All rows in the table will be updated.

Rule:
Always use WHERE to avoid updating all records.


5) DELETE Command
-----------------

Purpose:
DELETE is used to remove rows from a table.

Syntax:
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;


Example:
DELETE FROM Commentaire
WHERE id_commentaire = 3;


6) Conditional vs Total Deletion
--------------------------------

Conditional deletion (Recommended):
DELETE FROM Article
WHERE id_utilisateur = 2;

→ Deletes only specific rows

Total deletion (Dangerous):
DELETE FROM Article;

→ Deletes all rows in the table


7) Importance of WHERE (DELETE)
--------------------------------

Without WHERE:
DELETE FROM Commentaire;

Result:
All data in the table is permanently deleted.


8) Best Practices and Precautions
---------------------------------

- Always run a SELECT before UPDATE or DELETE
- Prefer using primary keys (id)
- Never run UPDATE or DELETE without WHERE
- Make a backup before deleting important data


9) Conclusion
-------------

UPDATE and DELETE are powerful SQL commands.
When used with WHERE conditions, they allow
safe and controlled data modification.
