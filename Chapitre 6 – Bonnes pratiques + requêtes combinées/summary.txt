SQL TRANSACTIONS – SUMMARY
==========================

1) Purpose
----------

SQL Transactions are used to execute multiple SQL
operations as a single logical unit.

They ensure data consistency and prevent partial
changes when an error occurs.


2) What is a Transaction?
-------------------------

A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements
that are executed together.

If all statements succeed → changes are saved
If one statement fails → changes are canceled
