SQL BASICS: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
=================================

1) SELECT
---------

Definition:
SELECT is used to retrieve data from a database table.
You can select all columns or only specific columns.

Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;

Example:
SELECT nom, email
FROM Utilisateur;

Explanation:
This query retrieves the names and emails of all users from the Utilisateur table.


2) WHERE
--------

Definition:
WHERE is used to filter records based on a condition.
Only rows that match the condition will be returned.

Syntax:
SELECT columns
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Example:
SELECT titre, date_publication
FROM Article
WHERE id_utilisateur = 1;

Explanation:
This query returns only the articles written by the user with ID 1.


Common WHERE operators:
- =   equal
- >   greater than
- <   less than
- >=  greater or equal
- <=  less or equal
- LIKE search pattern
- AND / OR combine conditions


Example using LIKE:
SELECT titre
FROM Article
WHERE titre LIKE '%Database%';

3) ORDER BY
-----------

Definition:
ORDER BY is used to sort the result set.

ASC  -> Ascending order (default)

SELECT columns
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column ASC|DESC;

WHERE date_publication >= '2024-05-01'
ORDER BY date_publication ASC;

Explanation:
This query returns articles published after May 1, 2024,
ordered by publication date from oldest to newest.
