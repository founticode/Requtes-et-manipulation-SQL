BLOG DATABASE – SQL PRACTICE SUMMARY
===================================

1) Project Context
------------------
This project is a simple Blog Database prototype.
It contains users, articles, and comments.
The goal is to practice SQL queries that answer
real business questions using relational data.


2) Main Tables Used
-------------------
- Utilisateur (Users)
  * id_utilisateur (PK)
  * nom
  * email
  * mot_de_passe

- Article (Posts)
  * id_article (PK)
  * titre
  * contenu
  * date_publication
  * id_utilisateur (FK → Utilisateur)

- Commentaire (Comments)
  * id_commentaire (PK)
  * contenu
  * auteur
  * date_commentaire
  * id_article (FK → Article)
  * id_utilisateur (optional FK)


3) Purpose of SQL Queries
-------------------------
SQL queries are used to answer real questions such as:
- Who wrote each article?
- How many articles did each user write?
- Which comments belong to which article?
- Which articles have multiple comments?


4) JOIN Usage
-------------
JOIN is used to combine data from multiple tables.

- JOIN (INNER JOIN):
  Returns only matching rows between tables.

- LEFT JOIN:
  Returns all rows from the left table,
  even if there is no match in the right table.

JOIN is necessary because data is distributed
across different tables.


5) Aggregate Functions
----------------------
Aggregate functions help analyze data:
- COUNT() → counts rows
- Used with GROUP BY to summarize data
- HAVING is used to filter grouped results

Example use cases:
- Count articles per user
- Count comments per article


6) GROUP BY and HAVING
----------------------
- GROUP BY groups rows by a column (e.g. article, user)
- HAVING filters groups after aggregation
- WHERE filters rows before grouping

These clauses are essential for statistics
and data analysis.


7) Real Business Questions Answered
-----------------------------------
- List articles with their authors
- Count how many articles each user wrote
- Display comments with article titles
- Find articles with more than one comment

These queries reflect real needs
in a blog or content management system.


8) Data Integrity and Relations
-------------------------------
Foreign Keys ensure data consistency:
- An article must belong to an existing user
- A comment must belong to an existing article

Incorrect foreign key values cause SQL errors,
which helps protect the database.


9) Conclusion
-------------
This practice demonstrates how SQL can be used
to answer business questions by:
- Structuring data into related tables
- Using JOINs to combine data
- Applying aggregation for analysis

These skills are essential for real-world
database and backend development.
